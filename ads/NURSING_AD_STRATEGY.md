# NurseInterviewPro.ai — Advertising Campaign Strategy
**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Budget:** $500–$1,000
**Landing Page:** interviewanswers.ai/nurse
**Status:** Live and verified. Ready for ad spend.
**Builds On:** AD_RESEARCH.md (psychology), AD_STRATEGY.md (platform playbook)

---

## WHY NURSING-SPECIFIC ADS WIN

The general InterviewAnswers.AI ads target everyone. Nursing-specific ads convert better because:

1. **Specificity sells.** "Practice nursing interview questions" > "Practice interview questions" — nurses self-select instantly
2. **Pain is specialized.** Nurses fear SBAR questions, clinical scenario questions, "tell me about a time" behavioral questions. Generic interview anxiety ads miss this
3. **Community is tight.** Nursing subreddits, Facebook groups, TikTok #nursetok, Instagram #nursinglife — these are hyper-engaged communities where word-of-mouth spreads fast
4. **The buyer knows the problem.** New grad nurses and nurses switching specialties KNOW they need interview help. They're Solution Aware (Schwartz Level 3) — we don't need to convince them they have a problem
5. **Willingness to pay.** Nurses spend on career tools (NCLEX prep, CE courses, resume services). A $29.99/month interview coach is priced below their expectation

---

## TARGET AUDIENCE

### Primary: New Grad Nurses (60% of ad spend)
- **Who:** BSN/ADN graduates about to enter the job market, or within first 1–2 years
- **Pain:** First real nursing interview. Terrified of clinical scenario questions. Know the medicine but freeze when asked "Tell me about a time..."
- **Where they live online:** Instagram, TikTok, Reddit r/nursing and r/studentnurse, Facebook nursing groups, Allnurses.com forums
- **Key insight:** They don't lack clinical knowledge — they lack interview SKILLS. That's exactly what we sell.

### Secondary: Specialty Switchers (25% of ad spend)
- **Who:** Experienced nurses transitioning to a new specialty (e.g., Med-Surg to ICU, Floor to ED)
- **Pain:** "I have 5 years of experience but I've never interviewed for [specialty]. What if they ask me specialty-specific questions I can't answer?"
- **Where they live online:** Facebook nursing groups, LinkedIn, Instagram
- **Key insight:** They need confidence, not knowledge. We coach how to frame existing experience for a new setting.

### Tertiary: Travel Nurses (15% of ad spend)
- **Who:** Nurses who interview frequently for short-term contracts
- **Pain:** Interview fatigue. Need to be sharp repeatedly. Want efficiency.
- **Where they live online:** TikTok #travelnurse, Facebook travel nurse groups, Instagram
- **Key insight:** Volume interviewers who value speed and structure.

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC CREATIVE PLANS

---

### PLATFORM 1: INSTAGRAM

#### Format: Reels (9:16, 15–30s) + Stories (9:16 static)

#### Nursing-Specific Hooks

**Hook A — The SBAR Fear (Loss Aversion)**
> Visual: Nurse in scrubs, nervous expression, hospital parking lot background
> Text overlay: "They're going to ask you an SBAR question. Are you ready?"
> Why: Every nursing student DREADS SBAR questions in interviews. Instant recognition.

**Hook B — New Grad Panic (Identity)**
> Visual: Phone screen showing the NurseInterviewPro specialty selection (ED, ICU, OR, L&D...)
> Text overlay: "I just graduated nursing school. I have NO idea how to interview for the ICU."
> Why: New grads feel imposter syndrome. Naming the specialty makes it personal.

**Hook C — The "Tell Me About a Time" Freeze (Empathy)**
> Visual: Split screen — left: nurse looking blank. Right: app showing STAR coaching feedback.
> Text overlay: "Tell me about a time you had a difficult patient." *brain goes completely blank*
> Why: THE universal nursing interview fear. We show the solution in the same frame.

**Hook D — Specialty Switch (Reframe)**
> Visual: Nurse looking at phone, dashboard showing specialty selection
> Text overlay: "5 years in Med-Surg. Zero ICU interviews. Until now."
> Why: Targets specialty switchers with specificity.

#### Ad Copy (Primary Text)
- **Short (≤125 chars):** "68 nursing interview questions. AI coaching that helps you tell YOUR clinical stories. Practice free."
- **Medium:** "You know the medicine. But when they ask 'Tell me about a time you advocated for a patient' — do you freeze? NurseInterviewPro coaches you through specialty-specific questions for ED, ICU, OR, L&D, and more. Try it free."

#### Hashtag Strategy
#nursinginterview #nurselife #nursingschool #newgradnurse #nursingcareer #nursejobs #SBAR #nurseinterviewtips #nursingstudent #nursetok #nursingcommunity #RN #BSN #travelRN

#### CTA
- Organic: "Link in bio — practice free"
- Paid: "Start Practicing Free" button → interviewanswers.ai/nurse

---

### PLATFORM 2: TIKTOK

#### Format: Vertical video (9:16), 9–15s
#### Style: UGC / native — must look like a real nursing TikTok, NOT a brand ad

#### Content Ideas (Can Produce Without UGC Creators)

**Video 1 — "POV: Your first nursing interview"**
> 9:16 vertical. Text on screen format.
> Frame 1 (0-2s): "POV: You just graduated nursing school and have your first interview tomorrow"
> Frame 2 (2-5s): "They ask: 'Tell me about a time you recognized a change in patient condition'"
> Frame 3 (5-8s): Screen recording of NurseInterviewPro SBAR coaching feedback appearing in real-time
> Frame 4 (8-12s): "This app has 68 real nursing interview questions with AI coaching" + "Link in bio"
> Audio: Trending anxious-then-relieved sound

**Video 2 — "Things I wish I knew before my nursing interview"**
> Talking-head style or text-on-screen
> Quick cuts listing tips, ending with "...and that there's an app that practices with you"
> Show brief app walkthrough
> Audio: Voiceover or trending sound

**Video 3 — "The nursing interview question that made me cry" (storytime hook)**
> Text overlay storytelling format
> Hook: dramatic story opening → show the question → show how the app helps you prepare
> Audio: Emotional/reflective trending sound

**Video 4 — Screen recording walkthrough**
> Show: Open app → select specialty (ED) → see questions → practice one → get AI feedback
> Text overlay narration: "This nursing interview app actually coaches you through SBAR..."
> Audio: Chill lo-fi or trending sound

#### TikTok Ad Copy
- "68 nursing interview questions. AI that coaches your SBAR delivery. Free to start."
- "New grad? Switching specialties? Practice the exact questions they'll ask."

#### CTA
- "Link in bio" for organic
- "Try It Free" overlay for App Install campaign

---

### PLATFORM 3: FACEBOOK

#### Format: Video (4:5) + Static (1080x1080) via Flexible Creative

#### Targeting Strategy
Facebook's power is targeting. Use these audiences:

**Custom Audiences:**
1. Website visitors (interviewanswers.ai/nurse) — retargeting
2. Lookalike of existing nursing track users (once we have 100+ users)

**Interest-Based Audiences:**
1. Nursing (occupation) + Job searching
2. NCLEX + Recent graduates
3. Nursing schools (specific school names as interests)
4. Travel nursing + Nursing agencies
5. Nursing career + Interview preparation

**Group Targeting:**
- People in Facebook groups: "New Grad Nurses", "Nursing Interview Tips", "ICU Nurses", "Travel Nurse Network"

#### Creative Set for Flexible Creative

**Videos (3):**
1. SBAR fear angle (15s) — "They WILL ask you an SBAR question. Here's how to nail it."
2. App walkthrough (15s) — Screen recording showing specialty selection → question → AI feedback
3. Before/after (15s) — Nervous new grad → confident prepared nurse (with app in between)

**Static Images (3):**
1. Phone mockup showing NurseInterviewPro dashboard + "68 Specialty-Specific Questions"
2. Split: BEFORE (blanking on "Tell me about a time...") → AFTER (structured STAR response with score)
3. Bold text: "You know the medicine. Now learn to sell it." + stethoscope icon + app logo

**Primary Text Variations:**
- "68 nursing interview questions across ED, ICU, OR, L&D, and 4 more specialties. AI coaching that helps you tell YOUR clinical stories — not memorize scripted answers. Practice free."
- "New grad? Switching specialties? You know the medicine but interview prep is different. NurseInterviewPro has SBAR drills, behavioral Q&A, and AI coaching built specifically for nursing interviews."

**Headlines:**
- "Nursing Interview Prep That Actually Works"
- "68 Questions. 8 Specialties. AI Coaching."
- "Stop Winging Your Nursing Interview"
- "SBAR Drills + AI Mock Interviews"

---

### PLATFORM 4: REDDIT

#### Strategy: Authentic engagement in nursing communities

**Target Subreddits:**
- r/nursing (800K+ members)
- r/studentnurse (150K+ members)
- r/newgrad (smaller but high-intent)
- r/travelnursing

#### Approach: Promoted Posts (not display ads)
Reddit users HATE obvious ads. The strategy:

**Promoted Post Option A — Value-First**
> Title: "I built a free nursing interview prep tool with 68 specialty-specific questions — looking for feedback from actual nurses"
> Body: Genuine description of what the app does, why it exists, link to try it. Frame as seeking community input.
> Why: Reddit rewards authenticity. "I built this" posts regularly hit front pages in niche subs.

**Promoted Post Option B — Resource Share**
> Title: "Free resource: 68 nursing interview questions organized by specialty (ED, ICU, OR, L&D, etc.)"
> Body: Share genuine value first (list some sample questions), then mention the app for AI coaching.
> Why: Resource posts get saved and shared. The value comes first.

**Budget:** $50–$100 on promoted posts, targeting nursing subreddits.

---
