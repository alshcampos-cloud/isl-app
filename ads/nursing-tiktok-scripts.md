## REDDIT POST TEMPLATES

### Post for r/studentnurse:
**Title:** "Free resource: 68 nursing interview questions organized by specialty (ED, ICU, OR, L&D, etc.)"

**Body:**
"Hey everyone — I helped build a free nursing interview prep tool and wanted to share it with this community.

It has 68 specialty-specific interview questions across 8 units (Emergency, ICU, Operating Room, Labor & Delivery, Pediatrics, Oncology, Med-Surg, and Psych/Behavioral).

What makes it different from generic interview prep:
- Questions are written and reviewed by healthcare professionals
- SBAR drill mode with per-component scoring (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
- AI coaching that evaluates your communication structure (STAR method), not clinical accuracy
- You pick your target specialty and get questions specific to that unit

It's free to start (5 practices/month) with a Pro tier if you want unlimited.

Link: interviewanswers.ai/nurse

Would love to hear feedback from anyone who tries it. What questions are missing? What would make it more useful?

(Disclaimer: I'm one of the builders, not a random shill account. Happy to answer any questions about how it works.)"

### Post for r/nursing:
**Title:** "We built a free nursing interview coaching tool — looking for feedback from actual nurses"

**Body:**
"Hey r/nursing — long time lurker. I work with a healthcare infection prevention professional and we built a nursing-specific interview prep tool.

The core idea: AI coaches your COMMUNICATION (SBAR structure, STAR method, specificity, confidence) but does NOT generate or evaluate clinical content. All 68 questions were written/reviewed by nurses.

Why we built it: Generic interview apps don't understand nursing interviews. They don't know what SBAR is, they don't have specialty-specific questions, and they definitely can't help you structure a clinical scenario answer.

Features:
- 68 questions across ED, ICU, OR, L&D, Peds, Onc, Med-Surg, Psych
- SBAR Drill with per-component feedback
- Practice mode with AI coaching
- Mock interview simulator

Free tier gives you 5 practices/month. Pro is $29.99/month for unlimited.

Link: interviewanswers.ai/nurse

Honestly looking for feedback. What interview questions do you wish you'd practiced? What's missing? What specialty should we add next?

(Full transparency: I'm a builder on this project, not a random ad account.)"
