**Based on:** AD_RESEARCH.md findings
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Status:** Pre-App Store approval (links → interviewanswers.ai, switch to App Store post-approval)

---

## PLATFORM PRIORITY ORDER

Based on research findings (audience fit, cost efficiency, format match):

| Priority | Platform | Why | Budget Allocation |
|----------|----------|-----|-------------------|
| **#1** | **Instagram (Reels)** | 3.2% engagement, 34.5% lower CPA, 55% reach to non-followers, best for app install | 35% |
| **#2** | **TikTok** | Cheapest CPMs ($2.60–$6.60), UGC-native, massive reach, 71% watch-through from hook | 30% |
| **#3** | **Facebook** | Mature targeting, Flexible Creative auto-optimization, video + static mix | 20% |
| **Deferred** | **YouTube Shorts** | Strong for app installs but requires more production | 10% |
| **Deferred** | **LinkedIn** | Expensive (3–5x CPCs) — only if targeting career changers specifically | 5% |
| **Not Now** | **GDN** | Good for retargeting later, not for initial awareness | 0% |

**Rationale:** Instagram Reels + TikTok combined cover 65% of budget. Both favor short-form video, both reward authenticity, both have the lowest CPAs for app installs. Facebook provides the mature testing infrastructure. YouTube Shorts and LinkedIn are Phase 2 when we have proven creative.

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC CREATIVE PLANS

---

### PLATFORM 1: INSTAGRAM REELS

**Format:** Vertical video (9:16), 15–30 seconds
**Dimensions:** 1080×1920
**Sound:** On (sound-on has 15% lower CPA on Reels)

#### Hook Strategy (First 3 Seconds)
Research says: 64% better completion rates with strong hooks. 0.4 seconds to stop the scroll.

**Hook A — Loss Aversion (Problem Aware)**
> Visual: Close-up of someone's face looking nervous, sitting in a waiting room
> Text overlay: "You're about to blow this interview."
> Why it works: Cognitive dissonance + loss aversion. Viewer thinks "no I'm not" or "wait, am I?"

**Hook B — Curiosity Gap (Solution Aware)**
> Visual: Phone screen showing the Live Prompter with real-time coaching text appearing
> Text overlay: "What if your phone could coach you through your interview?"
> Why it works: Curiosity gap — "how?" Also demonstrates the unique Live Prompter feature.

**Hook C — Social Proof (Product Aware / Retargeting)**
> Visual: Screen recording of the AI Mock Interviewer giving feedback
> Text overlay: "This app told me exactly why I wasn't getting callbacks."
> Why it works: Testimonial-style, social proof, names the pain.

#### Tone
Confident but empathetic. Not corporate. Not "Hey guys!" either. Think: a mentor who's been there and genuinely wants to help. Slightly provocative — willing to say "you're not ready" without being patronizing.

#### CTA Approach
- Primary: "Start preparing free — link in bio" (Reels don't support clickable links mid-video)
- For paid ads: "Try It Free" button (Meta's Install CTA)
- Identity frame: End card text "Become the candidate they remember."

#### Copy Structure (H.I.T. Framework Adapted)
1. **Hook (0–3s):** Pattern interrupt — name the pain or show the unexpected (Live Prompter UI)
2. **Insight (3–15s):** Reframe — "The problem isn't that you don't know the answer. It's that your brain freezes when it matters." Show the app solving this in real-time.
3. **Transfer (15–25s):** Identity shift — "People who use this don't just practice answers. They practice confidence." CTA card.

#### A/B Test Plan
- **Test 1:** Hook A (loss aversion face) vs Hook B (Live Prompter UI) — which stops more scrolls?
- **Test 2:** Identity CTA ("Become the candidate they remember") vs Action CTA ("Try It Free")
- **Test 3:** 15-second cut vs 25-second cut — which drives more installs?

#### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Hook rate (3-sec view) | > 40% | Proves the hook works |
| CTR | > 1.5% | Above platform average |
| CPI | < $3.00 | Sustainable for our budget |
| Video completion | > 25% | Shows content resonates |

---

### PLATFORM 2: TIKTOK

**Format:** Vertical video (9:16), 9–15 seconds (sweet spot per research)
**Dimensions:** 1080×1920
**Sound:** On (critical for TikTok)
**Style:** UGC / native — MUST look like a real TikTok, NOT a brand ad

#### Hook Strategy (First 2 Seconds)
Research says: First 3 seconds determine 71% of watch-through. Lo-fi > polished by 3:1.

**Hook A — "POV" Style**
> Visual: Person holding phone, recorded selfie-style
> Audio: "POV: You have an interview tomorrow and you just found an app that coaches you in real-time"
> Text overlay: Same as audio
> Why it works: POV format is native to TikTok. Creates immediate identification.

**Hook B — "The Thing That Changed Everything"**
> Visual: Person sitting in car post-interview, looks relieved/happy
> Audio: "I just got out of my interview and I have to tell you about this app..."
> Why it works: Story hook + social proof + curiosity

**Hook C — Problem + Shock**
> Visual: Split-screen — left: person blanking in interview (awkward silence). Right: same person with app, nailing it.
> Audio: Trending sound or voiceover
> Why it works: Visual contrast is a pattern interrupt

#### Tone
Conversational, authentic, slightly vulnerable. Like a friend sharing a genuine recommendation. Zero corporate polish. Natural lighting, handheld camera, real voice.

#### CTA Approach
- "Link in bio" or TikTok's "Install Now" overlay for App Install campaigns
- Verbal CTA: "You literally have nothing to lose — it's free"
- Never say "download" — say "try it" or "check it out"

#### Copy Structure (H.I.T. for TikTok)
1. **Hook (0–2s):** Person-to-camera opener that names a universal interview fear
2. **Insight (2–8s):** Quick app demo (screen recording of Live Prompter or AI feedback)
3. **Transfer (8–12s):** "Now I actually look forward to interviews" + CTA

#### Content We CAN Produce Without UGC Creators
Since we don't have UGC creators yet, we'll produce:
1. **Screen recording walkthroughs** — show the app doing its thing (native TikTok screen share feel)
2. **Text-on-screen story format** — "I used to fail every interview. Then I found this..." with app clips
3. **Green screen effect** — overlay app screenshots on common interview pain-point text
4. **Trending audio + app clips** — match popular sounds with relevant interview moments

#### Future UGC Plan (Post-Launch)
- Recruit 5–10 micro-creators ($150–$300/video) who are recent job seekers
- Brief them loosely: hook + key benefit + their own words
- Use Spark Ads to amplify their content

#### A/B Test Plan
- **Test 1:** POV style vs story style — which gets more 6-second views?
- **Test 2:** Screen recording focus vs person-to-camera focus
- **Test 3:** 9-second cut vs 15-second cut
- **Test 4:** Audio: voiceover vs trending sound

#### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| 6-sec view rate | > 30% | Past the conversion magic mark |
| CTR | > 1% | Good for TikTok |
| CPI | < $2.00 | TikTok's cost advantage |
| Share rate | > 0.5% | Organic amplification signal |

### PLATFORM 3: FACEBOOK (META)

**Format:** Video (4:5 vertical for Feed) + Static (1080×1080 for retargeting)
**Dimensions:** 1080×1350 (4:5 video), 1080×1080 (static)
**Text:** Primary ≤125 chars, Headline ≤40 chars

#### Creative Approach
Facebook in 2026 is an optimization engine. The strategy is: **maximum creative diversity + let Flexible Creative find winners.**

**Asset Set for Flexible Creative:**

**Videos (3 variations):**
1. Loss aversion angle (15s) — "You're preparing wrong. Here's how real interview prep works."
2. Live Prompter demo (15s) — Screen recording with voiceover showing real-time coaching
3. Before/after transformation (15s) — Nervous → confident with app UI in between

**Static Images (3 variations):**
1. Phone mockup showing Live Prompter UI + "What if you had a coach in your ear?"
2. Split: fumbling interview vs. confident interview + "Which one are you?"
3. Bold text-only: "You're not ready. And you can feel it." + small app icon

**Primary Text Variations (2):**
- Short: "AI that listens while you interview and coaches you in real-time. Try it free."
- Medium: "That pause when you blanked? The interviewer noticed. InterviewAnswers.AI gives you real-time coaching so you never freeze again."

**Headlines (3):**
- "Practice Confidence, Not Just Answers"
- "Real-Time Interview Coaching"
- "Stop Winging Your Interviews"

#### Tone
Slightly more polished than TikTok but still human. Direct, benefit-focused. Not salesy.

#### CTA
"Try It Free" (Meta's Install button) — research shows "download" underperforms for freemium apps.

#### A/B Test Plan
- Let Flexible Creative auto-optimize combinations
- Monitor: which video angle drives most installs? Which static works for retargeting?
- Rotate creative monthly to avoid Andromeda penalty

#### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| CTR | > 1.2% | Above average for app install |
| CPI | < $3.50 | Meta is pricier than TikTok |
| Frequency | < 3.0 | Avoid fatigue |
| ROAS (30-day) | > 1.0x | Break-even minimum |

### PLATFORM 4: YOUTUBE SHORTS (Phase 2)

**Format:** Vertical video (9:16), 15–30 seconds
**Dimensions:** 1080×1920

#### Strategy
Repurpose best-performing TikTok/Reels content with slight adjustments for YouTube's audience (slightly older, more intentional viewers).

**Key Differences from TikTok:**
- YouTube audience tolerates slightly longer content
- More emphasis on information/education vs. entertainment
- CTA button appears 3 seconds into the ad (design for this)
- Can pair Shorts with bumper ads for frequency

**Creative Plan:**
1. Adapt top-performing TikTok creative → YouTube Shorts format
2. Create 6-second bumper: "Stop winging interviews. [App logo]" (for awareness/frequency)
3. Test screen recording walkthrough (app demo) as a YouTube Short

---

### PLATFORM 5: LINKEDIN (Phase 2)

**Format:** Thought Leader Ad (sponsored personal post) OR single image/video
**Dimensions:** 1200×627 (link ads) or 1080×1080 (organic post)

#### Strategy
LinkedIn is too expensive for broad awareness. Use ONLY for:
1. **Thought Leader Ads** — We (or a career coach) post about interview anxiety from personal experience, with a soft CTA
2. **Career changer targeting** — Ads specifically for people changing careers who need interview practice
3. **Retargeting** — People who visited interviewanswers.ai but didn't sign up

**Creative Concept:**
A personal post from someone (ideally the founder) sharing: "I've coached hundreds of interview candidates. The #1 reason people don't get callbacks has nothing to do with their qualifications..." → leads to insight about communication + soft product mention.

This performs because:
- Thought Leader Ads feel like organic content (highest trust)
- Career content is native to LinkedIn
- Targets people in professional mindset
- Low-key product mention doesn't trigger ad resistance

## WHAT MAKES OUR ADS DIFFERENT

### The Competitive Gap We Own
Every competitor advertises features: "AI feedback," "mock interviews," "speech analysis." We advertise **transformation and identity.**

| What Competitors Say | What We Say |
|---------------------|-------------|
| "Practice with AI mock interviews" | "Stop losing interviews you should be winning" |
| "Get feedback on your answers" | "That pause when you blanked? The interviewer noticed." |
| "AI-powered interview prep" | "What if you had a coach in your ear?" |
| "Download our app" | "Become the candidate they remember" |

### Our Unique "Movie Trailer Moment"
The Live Prompter. No competitor has this. When we show someone in an actual interview with real-time coaching text appearing on their phone — that's the moment that makes people say "wait, it does WHAT?" This is our MasterClass-style hook. Lead with it.

### Our Visual Identity Advantage
Purple-to-gold gradient in a sea of blue/white tech apps. We look premium, distinct, and recognizable. Every ad should reinforce this visual identity.
