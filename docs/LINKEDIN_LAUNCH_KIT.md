## 1. NEW HEADLINE

Emergency Dept Customer Navigator @ Stanford Health Care | MS Emergency Management, USC | Creator, InterviewAnswers.ai

---

## 2. NEW ABOUT SECTION

I work in patient experience at Stanford Health Care, with pediatric and adult Emergency Department patients. Master of Science in Emergency Management from USC, Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from USF. Bilingual, 5+ years across healthcare — case management, rehabilitation, clinical settings, and the emergency department.

I created InterviewAnswers.ai because I got tired of the interview cycle. You send out hundreds of applications, hear back from a few, finally get in front of a panel, and realize you haven't practiced enough. Then you start over.

So I combined my psychology background and what I learned in my Master's program, and built a tool that lets you practice out loud and get real feedback without wasting real opportunities.

With guidance from a Master's-prepared Registered Nurse, we created a live nursing interview track featuring clinically reviewed questions across 8 specialties. I'm using my emergency management education to develop EM-specific tools next — building for that world from both a practitioner and builder perspective.

## 4. LINKEDIN POST (The Launch Post)

Hey everyone — I've been pretty quiet on here, so I wanted to share something I've been working on.

For years I've been designing tools to help me improve as a person and gain more knowledge and skills. After finishing my Master's at USC, I found myself in need of a new one.

Recently I decided to take one of those tools public — one that could help the general public and nursing applicants. I happen to be in the company of nurses 24/7, so I saw the need firsthand.

I used my risk assessment, project management, and stakeholder engagement skills for something outside of emergency management, combined with my psychology and tech background, to try something new.

The result is InterviewAnswers.ai — an AI-powered interview coach. Here's what it does:

→ AI mock interviews that adapt to your answers and push you to be specific
→ STAR method coaching that breaks down your answers and tells you what's missing
→ A live prompter that gives you real-time guidance while you speak — wire those neurons before the real thing
→ A nursing interview track with clinically reviewed questions across 8 specialties and a curated resource library — built with real clinical professionals, not generated by AI
→ A personal database that tracks your answers so you can learn from past attempts and identify patterns
→ Gamification to keep you engaged and progressing
→ Personalized feedback on structure, delivery, confidence, and specificity after every answer

Our Chief Quality Officer is a Master's-prepared Registered Nurse. Our DevOps Engineer keeps everything running and tested.

This is just the first project. Emergency management, psychology, and social sector tools are coming next.

If you or someone you know has an interview coming up, give it a try and let me know what you think.
