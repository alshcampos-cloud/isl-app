# Draft Interview Questions for Erin's Review — V2
## Sourced from Verified Nursing Competency Standards
### NurseInterviewPro — InterviewAnswers.AI Nursing Track

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Branch:** feature/nursing-track
**Status:** DRAFT — All questions require Erin's clinical review and approval before entering the app.
**Walled Garden:** These questions were derived from published competency frameworks (NCSBN, ENA, AACN, AORN, AWHONN, PNCB, APNA, AMSN, MSNCB, ANCC, BCEN, NCC, Joint Commission, NLC). The AI coaches communication — it does not generate or evaluate clinical content.
